Releasing Nansat
==================

General release procedure
-------------------------

In setup.py, Make sure the version is correct, by checking MAJOR, MINOR and MICRO, and that 'dev'
is removed from VERSION.

Releases should be made from the master branch. **Make sure that Nansat works on all operating
systems (Windows, Linux and OS X), with all combinations of python (py27, py35, py36) before
releasing.**

When you are ready to release a new version, create a tag for the release and push it.
The following creates a tag for version 0.6.17 and pushes it.

::

  git tag "v0.6.17"
  git push origin --tags

Go to https://github.com/nansencenter/nansat/releases and click "Draft a new release".

Select the tag version you just created, create a release title, for consistency, use the format of
Nansat-0.6.17

Write some release notes that describes the changes done in this release.


Releasing on PiPy
-----------------

First, wait until Nansat passes all tests on Travi-CI, Appveyor and Coverals. Then execute:

   conda create -n release_nansat -c conda-forge -y python pythesint scipy basemap netcdf4 gdal pillow mock nose urllib3 twine
   source activate release_nansat
   python setup.py sdist
   # Check the dist file that was just created
   ls dist

   conda install -n root -c conda-forge conda-smithy
   git clone git@github.com:conda-forge/nansat-feedstock.git
   cd nansat-feedstock
